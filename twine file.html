Christophe thinks too much. He sees a very large cheese sign (In the shape of a wooden sign) planted into the cheese floor.

The further he gets, the quieter the screams get. However, they never seem to go away.

Christophe walks until he&#39;s reached the end of the town. There&#39;s nothing left out here. It&#39;s like a cheese desert.

The screaming doesn&#39;t stop. He keeps walking.

Christophe walks for a long time. He isn&#39;t sure how long it&#39;s been, or how long it will be. He just wants the noise to go away.

Christophe is good on food, everything is made of cheese. He&#39;s practically the Expert of Eat Dirt. However, water is kind of an issue. He needs water to live. Unfortunately, there hasn&#39;t been any water. He feels his throat start to hurt, and his energy start to dwindle.

The screaming doesn&#39;t stop. Christophe keeps walking.

About fifty people stare at him, mortified. No one blinks. The cheese people are all shocked beyond belief.

Liquid cheese begins to flood through the city. One may call it &quot;liquid gold,&quot; but that would be very disrespectful to all the cheese people who died in the incident. Of which there were many.

Chrsitophe was deemed a threat, and was banned from Cheese World. Many see this as confusing, as Christophe had already died.

Cheese World takes a few months to rebuild, but they&#39;ve been back in business ever since.

However, the toll the incident has taken on families across the cheese world would not be forgotten.

The cashier smiles and takes the cheese from the counter. He pretends to scan it and gives it back to Christophe. &quot;Your total comes to two cheese.&quot; He holds his hand out.

Chrsistophe pauses. &quot;Why would I buy cheese with cheese?&quot;

The shopkeeper&#39;s smile begins to fade. &quot;Oh.&quot; He puts his hand back under the counter. &quot;Oh god.&quot;

&quot;Um-&quot;

Despair fills the shopkeeper&#39;s face. They are completely and utterly defeated. This confuses and upsets Christophe, causing him to leave immediately.
